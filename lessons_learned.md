# Security and Integration Lessons Learned

## Authentication & Authorization

### 1. Form-Based Authentication Best Practices
- Always use proper form data serialization with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format
- Use `URLSearchParams` for proper form data handling
- Include `credentials: 'include'` for proper session management
- Keep authentication flows simple and match security framework expectations
- Monitor backend logs for authentication failures (e.g., "Failed to find user ''")

### 2. JWT Implementation Guidelines
- Include essential claims in JWT tokens (roles, client context, user metadata)
- Implement comprehensive token validation beyond just username and expiration
- Use different structures for access and refresh tokens
- Include device/IP fingerprinting in tokens
- Implement proper token blacklisting with persistence
- Use event-driven cleanup for token management

### 3. Authentication Flow Security
- Implement proper rate limiting with IP rotation detection
- Add comprehensive authentication audit logging
- Consider implementing remember-me functionality
- Never pass null HttpServletRequest in form-based login
- Implement proper session management and timeout policies

## CSRF Protection

### 1. CSRF Token Management
- Avoid duplicate CSRF token generation across different components
- Implement consistent cookie settings (path, secure, httpOnly)
- Never log CSRF token values
- Set proper SameSite attributes for CSRF cookies
- Implement CSRF token rotation for sensitive operations
- Validate token age and origin

## Error Handling

### 1. Error Response Standards
- Maintain consistent error codes across the application
- Avoid duplicate error response classes
- Use consistent constructor patterns for error responses
- Implement specific exception handlers for different scenarios
- Categorize errors properly (validation, business logic, system)
- Avoid overly broad exception handling

## Security Configuration

### 1. Security Headers and CORS
- Implement all necessary security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Avoid deprecated security methods
- Configure restrictive CORS policies
- Use role or permission-based security rules instead of static configurations

### 2. Authentication Mechanisms
- Support multiple authentication methods
- Consider implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Implement step-up authentication for sensitive operations

## Performance and Scalability

### 1. Data Management
- Use distributed caches instead of in-memory storage
- Implement proper cache expiration strategies
- Monitor memory usage in high-traffic scenarios
- Design for scalability in clustered environments

### 2. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement consistent log levels
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Collect performance and security metrics
- Use proper logging frameworks and patterns

## Code Quality

### 1. Architecture and Organization
- Maintain consistent package structure
- Avoid inner classes in configuration
- Eliminate duplicate functionality
- Document security architecture and flows
- Add comprehensive JavaDoc and comments for complex logic

### 2. Frontend Integration
- Keep authentication flows simple and direct
- Use native APIs when possible (e.g., fetch API)
- Match backend security expectations exactly
- Test with network monitoring tools
- Verify request formats and headers
